    <h1>Shredded Ranch Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/RanchChiken.jpg" alt="Pan Chicken" height="500" width="500">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my favorite of the three. Not only is it super easy to make it is very good and stores really well too. Serve on rice either brown or 
        white rice works. Also works on noodles epecially egg noodles. This specific variation of the dish is realtively hard to find (based on my own searching for it)
        but many variations exist.
